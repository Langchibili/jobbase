// when chat is loaded with uid = 0
     check if the loggedInUser has any chatrooms existing
        id so
           the user's chatrooms should be shown
    if you are the other user from (uid), check if any of the chatrooms you have have messages in them
        if so, show the chatroom on your list of chatrooms
        if not, don't show the chatroom
        if the chatroom without messages is the only one existing, show a users search screen
   when the chat is loaded with a uid and hence u load the chatroom with the uid
        if it exits, show messages, because it means they are some messages in it
        if not, then create a new chatroom, link it to both users
        then create a message and push it into the chatroom
   if a message is of normal type, just post it, then add it just add to to the chatroom with the messages count going up by 1
   if user wants to send media, they have to send from what they added to their profile, no new media uploads from chatroom

   whether you have messages to a chatroom or not doesn't matter to the creation of massages
   and to the showcase of messages

   shouldn't forget to put the default images inside the uploads directory of the api
